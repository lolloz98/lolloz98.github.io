The device was able to detect if people were in the room: if so, it would send a notification to the user. I have mainly worked on the live-streaming of the video: the server (developed with NodeJS) needed to put in communication the raspberry and the app on the android phone to let former one be able to stream the video. We decided not to publish the app because of the costs due to the server setup (and maintainance).",
